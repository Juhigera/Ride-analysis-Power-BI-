Ride Data Analysis Dashboard — Power BI Project
📌 Project Overview

This project involves building a 3-page interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze rides, vehicles, and customer behavior. The dashboard provides actionable insights into ride trends, revenue, cancellations, vehicle performance, and payment patterns.
